# Prompt Engineering - Part 2

This repository provides an overview of a Python script that demonstrates the
usage of the OpenAI API for various natural language processing tasks, including
sentiment analysis, topic inference, summarization, and question-answering.
Additionally, it showcases the training of a Word2Vec model for word embeddings
using a sample dataset.

## Usage

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the Open AI API key.
2. Copy all the files to the Google Colab environment.
